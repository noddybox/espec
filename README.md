# espec

espec is a basic emulation of the 48K Spectrum.  It was mainly done as a test bed for my Z80 emulation.

## Usage

To run it simply run the generated `espec` executable.  It reads configuration from `$HOME/.espec`, an example of which can be found in `example_config`.

In use the keyboard is as the Spectrum, with the left hand side shift, control and alt keys acting as Caps Shift, and the right hand shift, control and alt keys acting as Symbol Shift.  The backspace and delete key is mapped to the Spectrum delete and the cursor keys are mapped to the appropriate shifted number keys.

To quit the emulator press the ESCAPE key.

To get a quick help press F1.

As described in the help, the function keys do the following:

F1 - Display the help message

F2 - Display a message about the emulator.

F3 - Display the Spectrum keyboard for reference.

F4 - View any mounted tape files.

F8 - Select the TAP file used to loading.

F9 - Select the TAP file used for saving.

F10 - Close any open tape files.

F11 - Display the Memory Menu.

F12 - Display an overlay of the current state of the Z80 CPU while the system is running.

## TAP Files

The emulator only supports the use of TAP files, which are simple binary representation of the contents of a tape.

## Memory Menu

The memory menu allows you to inspect the state of the running system, mainly for debugging purposes.  At all points indicated you can press F1 to get an overview of the available keys.

As a general note, when an address is prompted for you can enter expressions, register names and can use different bases.  For instance `pc` will enter the address as the current contents of the Program Counter.  By default numbers are decimal.  To use hex number prefix the value with `0x`.

### Main Menu

The main memory menu offers these options:

#### 1 - Disassemble/Hex dump

Displays a disassembly or hex dump of memory, press F1 to get an overview of the keys.

#### 2 - Disassemble to file

Saves a disassembly to a file.  It will prompt for a start address, and number of bytes to disassemble and the name of an output file.  If no path is specified the file will be output to the current directory.

#### 3 - Start/Stop trace log

This option will start and stop the tracing of CPU state to a trace file, called `trace` which it will output to the current directory.

#### 4 - Playback trace log

This will allow you to play through the contents of a saved `trace` file.  Press F1 for details of the available key commands.  Note that the disassembly will be memory as it is NOW rather than at the time of the trace.

#### 5 - Add a new breakpoint

Allows you to enter an expression which will cause a breakpoint to be trigger.
There are two modes.

If the expression has an == check in it then the breakpoint
will be triggered if the expression evaluates true, e.g. `hl==0x1234` will stop
if the HL register pair holds the value 0x1234.

If there is no equality check then the value is taken as a value to stop at
when the Program Counter equals that value.

#### 6 - Set active breakpoints

Allows you to set which breakpoints are active.  Follow the on-screen prompts.

#### 7 - Remove a breakpoint

Allows you to remove a selected breakpoint.  Follow the on-screen prompts.

#### 8 - Clear all breakpoints

Prompts as to whether to clear all breakpoints.

#### 9 - Monitor

Allows you to monitor the running system, single stepping, running (and optionally watching) the system, and doing so till a breakpoint is hit.  Press F1 for details of the available key commands.

#### R - Reset

Reset the running system.

#### X - Exit (without confirm)

Exits the emulator without prompting you first.

#### ESCAPE - Return

Return to the running system.
